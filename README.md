# VoiceToText

Simple Voice-to-Text application built using Python and the `speech_recognition` library. The app listens to your voice through a microphone, converts the speech to text, and displays it in real time. You can also copy the transcribed text to your clipboard and save it to a file.

## Installation
1. Install Python: Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
2. Install Dependencies: You will need to install the following libraries:
* `speech_recognition`: For voice recognition.
* `pyperclip`: To handle clipboard functionality.
* `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (GUI).

```
pip install SpeechRecognition pyperclip
```
```
pip install tk
```
